# lift_simulator
--This is a lift_simulator project that uses technologies like HTML, CSS and vanilla js .
--The idea of the project is to take the input from the users for  number of floor and number of lifts in the first page and when we 
  hover over the simulate button , the second page with respective floor number and lift number appears. 
--Arrays are used to update and store the movement of the lift. Therefore after a certain interval when the 
  lift reaches the destination ,the next lift moves and tends to reach the same destination when the button of that floor is 
  pressed twice. 
--This process is carried out consecutively for the next lift inputs as well.The movement of the lifts along 
  with the opening and closing of the door functions because of vanilla js integrated in the code.
